When it arrived, though, it was disappointment after disappointment. First, no batteries. Then, when we put in the batteries, it didn\'t work. We had to fiddle with the batteries and the battery door to get the "sweet spot" to make it work. Then, the keyboard area wasn\'t very responsive to touch so he couldn\'t get notes he wanted.

I order two sets for a total of eight pieces and not one of the eight was 4 inches at there widest point. They were advertised as 4-5 inches and this was a key point in my decision to purchase. Further, they were to arrive in a "gift box", they arrived in cardboard with the rubber feet in the box for me to attach. I\'m so glad I didn\'t send these directly as a gift. They are pretty but they will not even fit a coffee mug so they are not effective as coasters which is what I order. :-(', 'HUGE disappointment. These coasters are so beautiful. But the LEAK pink on everything. TRAGIC.', 'The dye from these coasters stained my counter tops. The counter was sealed and I caught it soon enough to get the main punch of color out after a few treatments but there is still a shadow that will not fully go away. On another note these are extremely small and do not measure up to a "same size" set I purchased from another vendor previously. As others have said they may or may not be pretty like the picture (only one in my set was).', 'If you need real coasters, keep looking. They will protect your surfaces from heat and rings. But, they are totally non-absorbent, with no way to catch liquid, slightly slippery, and -with only three surface contact points- they are potentially unstable. On the other hand, they are unique (I suspect no two are the same) and attractive. I put these out with silicone coasters beneath them for stability and to give an option if a real coaster is needed. I have no idea how easily they might crack if dropped, or if a very hot item is placed on them.', "I was so excited for these since they are so trendy but I put a glass of cold water on one (which was sweating) and when I moved the coaster it stained my white side table. I have been scrubbing it with a magic erase sponge but it won't come off.", 'I\'m underwhelmed. I expected that what I received would not necessarily match the picture, because there is a natural variation in rocks. I did, however, expect that the colors would be vibrant as represented in the picture (they aren\'t). They are almost dingy, even after washing with a gentle soap and drying with a t-shirt as suggested to others here. It also grinds my gears that someone in these reviews was told by the seller (customer service) that these aren\'t real agate. If they\'re dyed stone to create the agate look, then that should be disclosed in the description. Fair play if it is now, but I read through at the time of my purchase it was not noted by the seller. The packaging was OK. A box within a box. The smaller box that contained the slices could have been done providing more protection; all four were wrapped in paper, but there was no buffer between the slices, so they have scratches from each other on the outside rim due to what can only be slightly rubbing against each other during packaging and ship. Not tragic, but another nudge toward the "meh". Rubber bumpers were not included in my package. I\'m semi-crafty, so I had some already. No big deal, but worthy of note since they are supposed to be included. Sizes varied greatly. Some are OK, but one in particular is barely large enough to hold a bottle of mildly impressive hipster grade beer. Also, the thickness of the slices vary greatly as well. One is thick enough to be considered a nice solid weight, one is normal and two are quite thin. I would worry about structural integrity if I was to accidentally drop it. (some may crack, but two would definitely shatter on impact). It kinda drives me a little nuts that I can\'t neatly stack them in a manner that is aesthetically pleasing. Overall: They\'re fine, but I definitely wouldn\'t make this purchase again.', 'These look amazing! But our glasses formed condensation and stuck to them, so when you picked up your glass, the coaster would come with it, fall, and shatter :(', "Well I'm sad to say that this product was not great as coasters for a table. Sadly the sharp edges and very small silicone pads only provide enough stability to fool the user into thinking the platform will remain stable once something is placed on top.

{'asin': 'B00WY3T1BU', 'comments': ['I have used Amazon for years, and this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. Our 4.5 month son still has the Moro (startle) reflex, so he needed a sleep sack that lightly holds his arms. If he was not swaddled in a sleep sack, he woke up constantly... We were using the "Love to dream Swaddle Up 50/50" (highly recommend if your baby can bust out of swaddling blankets like ours). With the Swaddle Up sack, he was sleeping well and only waking once or twice per night to eat (if he woke up any other time he would fall back to sleep on his own). But once he learned to roll from front to back we had to free his arms for safety. Enter the Zen sleep sack. I was fully prepared for a nightmare transition to sleeping arms out. However, the first night he slept from 7:30pm to 5:30am straight! Then last night he slept from 7:30pm to 6:30am straight! I sent it to daycare with him yesterday as well. He sleeps in his crib at night but would scream and cry endlessly if laid in a crib for naps. He only wanted to sleep in the Rock N Play for naps. Daycare put the Zen sleep sack on him and laid him in the crib and he was knocked out within a minute and had his best naps yet (all three yesterday)! I know it\'s only been two days, but I am in love with this product. My son peed through his diaper last night, and wet the sack so I had to leave it at home to wash it. I am buying a second Zen sleep sack today so I am never without it again. I highly recommend!', '5 month old daughter had been only sleeping 2-4 hour stretches and up many times at night. Night one of zen sack she slept 7.5 hours. Since using it for 2 weeks now she sleeps at least 6.5-8.5 hour stretches. So happy with this product.', "The four month sleep regression hit my house hard. My son once was an excellent sleeper and than poof nights became our enemy. At four oclock in the morning upon what felt like the millionth time waking up with my son I remembered something. Something that was going to turn it all around. Hadn't someone told me about the magic of a weighted sleep sack? Frustrated I looked it up, ordered it and even paid the extra to have one day delivery. The first night he wore this I laid him down awake. He smiled up at me and proceeded to pass out on his own. Now he was a good sleeper before but not like this. This was game changing. Mind blowing. Jump up and down and scream yippee exciting. This kid never budged. He passed right out, woke up once to eat and promptly fell back asleep. It's been 3 week of sleep like this and it's the same every night. 3 glorious weeks. 3 weeks of a happy baby and a happy mama. If I haven't sold you yet just wait theres more! Have you set an alarm since your little one was born? Yeah me either. UNTIL NOW! We have not only gotten sleep but slept in until 9! no that is not a typo. Yes ladies and gentlemen! 9!!!! Step right up and buy your own for a restful night. Think about it. What does your baby want? He wants a little comfort while he is learning to put himself back to sleep. Comfort like your hand on his chest or in this case a little warm sleeping bag with a weighted pouch that mimics that exact feeling. Brilliant I tell you! This is amazing. Buy it. Don't think twice. It's worth every freaking penny and then some. A big thank you to the woman that invented this. From the bottom of my rested heart...thank you... ps I use it at nap time too", "didn't make any difference for us. When i contacted Nested Bean they never responded.", "My 4 month old has always been a great sleeper until he hit his 4 month sleep regression. He would wake up constantly and fuss and not be able to get himself back to sleep. It coincided with me going back to work as well and I was exhausted. I bought this just because he was growing out of his other sleep sack and liked the reviews on the quality of it. I wasn't totally convinced it would help with his sleeping. First night in it he slept 12 hours and only woke up once to nurse at around 7 hours. He went right back to sleep after! The quality is fantastic and I like how it zips which allows me to easily slip my sleeping baby into it. I struggled with the front zipper on the halo sleep sacks because it always seemed to wake him up. This is a wonderful quality sleep sack, and the better sleep is an added bonus!", 'My 6 month old son has never been much of a napper. He sleeps well at night, but would only sleep for 30 minutes at a time during the day. Now that he’s in his crib, he tends to wake up once or twice during the night. Just yesterday, I tried the Nested Bean Zen Sack. OH MY GOODNESS...it was like magic!!! He took a two hour nap and then slept from 8pm-7am. I honestly couldn’t believe it, as I have tried EVERYTHING to get him to nap longer. I am so thankful for this sleep sack and would recommend it to anyone!!', 'Amazing! I was skeptical and didn’t notice an immediate difference but my daughter went from waking every 2 hours and worked up to sleeping a full 7-8 hours without a peep! Still being skeptical I went without it for 3 nights... worst 3 nights of our lives she was back to waking every 3 hours! The night I went back to the sleep sack 8 hours of silence and perfect sleep! Worth the money, we have washed it and it turned out great! Looking to buy a back up one now!', "Works like magic! I don't know if it would work well if your little one is not ready to be unswaddled, but my LO started fussing and breaking out of his Woombie at around 5 months, so I tried this. He slept GREAT in it from the first night on. If left unswaddled he'd typically rub his eyes like crazy and keep himself up with his hands, then sleep with his hands over his head which I thought was normal, but I think they just ended up this way because he was restless. With this he sleeps with his hands to his side and barely ever rubs his face. Highly recommend it if your LO is ready to transition!!"]},

The other one that I have, when you squeeze the trigger gives you one long continuous spray of fine mist. These ones give you a short spray of fine mist, then they sputter fat drops out, then gives you another short fine mist spray. This was with water, so I can't even imagine it handling anything heavier like oils, that I can use in my 10 oz bottle.", "I love these bottles! I originally bought the Groom Industries Solvent Free Sprayer, Flairosol after seeing my hair stylist use it. I use it to mist my orchid, but it's a pain to refill and be able to get the bottle full enough with the bag. Having to swirl the straw inside to expand the bag is a hassle. When I decided I was going to move on from aerosol air fresheners to making my own, I know I didn't want the hassle of dealing with the bag. I found these which have much more capacity and NO BAG! My mother in law was so impressed with them when she was visiting us she asked if she could take one home. I ordered a second set because they're great to refresh your room or linens with your own customizable spray.", "This item mists beautifully!!! I have been using this sprayer to hold and spray my 4 year old daughter's homemade detangler (Leave in conditioner + water). We have been using it for 3 months and it still mists beautifully to the back of her hair. I would not use this product on thicker products (pure Aloe Vera, trust me, I tried). Thicker products will ruin the mist and turn it into one thick stream spray.", 'This is much better than your cheap $1 squirt bottle. I has a long mist with each squeeze. It truely is a mist and not a light stream. My hair gets wet more evenly then before when I used a cheap squirt bottle. Previously I would have sections that were sopping wet where other parts are dry. I use it in the morning to freshen my curls on days I do not wash them. This is very much worth the money.', 'Just discovered these spray misters recently from my sewing and quilting friends. Proper ironing/pressing is so important to achieve that professional look for my sewing projects. I had been using the liquid pressing aids (Best Press) directly out of the spray bottles they come in but found my fingers and hand get cramped up after a short while from the pumping action of the spray bottles. The sprays from those bottles also come out quite splotchy. Then I discovered these misting bottles and omg they are the best things ever!!! They are so comfortable to use in the hand. Gone are the cramped fingers/hands and the spray comes out in a very evenly distributed mist over my fabrics. As a result the liquids i use last longer, saving me money in the process. I have now found other uses for these bottles. I have one with just plain water, one with vinegar for cleaning, and have shared a few with friends. I love them! The small 5 oz bottles don’t take up much room but I may want to get the next size up just so it can hold more liquid. The quality of these bottles is excellent, I would highly recommend!!!', 'I thought it would be a strong continuing mist as well, but I find that if you give two or three quick pumps it does lay a constant fine mist. I hope they work longer than a week or two.', 'While it does a great job spraying, I thought it was something you could hold down. Poor marketing and understanding on my part. Requires you to pump for each spray, and how much you pump determines how long it sprays. However in some cases it freaks out and doesn\'t spray as much after a full pump. Furthermore the "straw" that\'s used to get water from the container is too long. While it reaches the bottom... it bends and sometimes gets stuck right against the plastic making it hard to get water quickly. I had to take it out from the container and use a knife to cut the straw\'s edges so it could get water better when smashed against the floor of the container.', 'Perfect. I needed a mister -not a sprayer and this is exactly that. One trigger pull gives a long continuous mist spray. I use it when I paint furniture and don’t want drip marks but need to wet the paint on the piece a little bit. Great to help blend paint colors and especially if you’re painting on a hot day outside. Works double duty. I just wish it was bigger- def looks bigger online but arrived small. Guess I need to be a better judge of the fluid ounces when they list them.']},

We had to drill four holes in it. We broke three drill bits in the process.

I would definitely recommend using Source One.', 'If you are wondering whether 1/16th of an inch is sturdy, I can tell you it is. More so than you might think. It doesn\'t flex or bend when handled, and it is actually thick enough to be Dremeled, if you need to "engrave" it somehow. The discs are covered with plastic film on both sides, and the film is a bit of a pain to remove---so do yourself a favor and grab a pair of tweezers right away---it will save you some frustration.', "Exactly what I was looking for. Thick, but not too thick. Thick enough to keep from warping or bending, not so thick it's too heavy (like glass). I'm hoping I don't scratch it up too much - going to use it for oil paint mixing.

But this kalimba allowed me to play simple songs via sheet music as expected, but within 30 min of picking it up I was transposing music into it's key on the fly and also improvising.

Many people wrote that their's arrived in tune and while mine was close, it wasn't. I've also had some experience with these instruments and the buzzing on the high notes and the A was exceptionally high. I also believe that the one I received may have been previously returned as it did not come with papers or the booklet that contained music. There is also very slight chipping on the paint of the letters on the tines. I can tune the instrument myself but I would have liked to have had the papers and booklet. There is no body damage.

{'asin': 'B07546PLRZ', 'comments': ["After several weeks of heavy use in EMS, hospital, and military environments, I assure you that this will be the last set of diagnostic pen lights you'll need for a while. I bought two boxes (4 total) and haven't killed the first one yet. They have continued working no matter how many times I drop, submerge, and get sand in them. The generic $5 penlights I bought before never would have lasted this long. I'd always buy them in bulk because i expected them to die quickly. I'd need to push the bulb in to get it to work. The bulb and plastic body might crack from a drop. The clip would break or fall off. The battery would drain in my pocket. Not with this this. I think it's the way that these are designed. The sunken bulb means it's harder to damage from a drop. The clips (while they FEEL cheap) are pretty well-secured. The battery compartment screws tightly. The body is metal (aluminium?) and the button is covered by a rubber cap, so it doesn't turn on in my pocket. Each pen light also comes with replacement bulb in case it does break. I applaud Risemart. I'm very impressed. Reviewed on 10/6/18. UPDATE ON 04/15/19: Still using the first one I opened out of the four I ordered. No issues!", 'I ordered these pens for my nursing class. I thought if I got two I would have a back up if needed. They both work fine and you can change the light tip to a soft yellow light or a bright LED light. I like that you have options with it. It came with batteries but I used some name brand batteries because the brand I use have a long life and I read that the batteries that come with them are not that great from some other reviews. It seems to be made of a nice weight metal, has a soft button tip on the end for on/off, and has a pupil gauge on the side. The "red" is actually hot pink which I was stoked about. I add pink to my uniform whenever I can. Fits perfecting in my pocket organizer with some other items. I practiced on my husband with it and he said the light was not that harsh. The dog did not seem to mind it either.', "I originally purchased a penlight from my campus store as I wanted a new one to replace my work ones going into the nursing program.

Definitely will buy again!', 'I bought these to replace my old pen lights. The previous brand I had would sporadically turn on or not turn on all the way when I clicked the button, but would brighten up when I tapped it. It was a loose connection. This was on both of them. That being said, I really love the feel of this new set of pen lights. The feel very sturdy, they have nice tight connections and good contacts betwythe battery and the on switch. Easy to wipe clean with PDI wipes without staining or smeared paint. So much more reliable than others.', "I like these penlights, BUT I only gave them 4 stars because 2 out of 2 penlights did not work correctly at first. The light kept flicking on and off when I moved it. I contacted customer service about the 1st one and they sent me a whole new set. In the meantime, I figured out how to get the penlight to stay on. When I got the new set, I gave away the original penlight and used one of the new ones. It too flicked on and off. I figured out that the little metal piece on the part with the bulb needs to be pulled out a bit to keep contact with the battery, so now it stays on. Otherwise, the lights are very durable and they don't accidentally turn on like some other penlights. Customer service is great and they said the penlights have a 1 year warranty.", 'I bought these for nursing school and I really love them. They are heavy and do not feel cheap at all. I like that they are non porus and it allows for reusing and cleaning with a proper antimicrobial wipe. Also comes with batteries. The colors are exactly as depicted.', 'Works perfect!']},

It turns on immediately when the power is switched to on and cycles through a fading rainbow. A strong tap will reset the fade cycle back to red, it's not tap nearly as sensitive as other similar children's lights. The kids like it even though it is not rechargeable, so we'll keep it. But if we had known it was not rechargeable, we definitely would not have purchased it. Buyer beware. Be advised that it is not soft and squishy, it will hurt if a child throws it at someone. It's a lot harder than it looks.", 'My daughter loves this! And I also thought it was the cutest little thing! I love how just by tapping it you can change the colors! My girl is not even two and already learned how to do it! Also I love that it’s rechargeable! I hate having to replace batteries!

I bought this glass bottle cutter tool for this project and I am very pleased with it. I've been able to cut the bottles easily, the cutting machine works very well and easy, and also the video tutorial they provide was a great help. The project was a success, I moved the plants inside the wine bottles I cut with the cutting device and it works very well.

I will be the first to admit that I was hesitant to try this DIY method because cutting glass just seems so, I do not know, messy and risky. I've read about it on the internet, and I've decided to order this glass cutter, as it seemed to be the best deal out there. Well, I did not regret at all, on the contrary. I discovered that cutting bottles with this bottle cutting device is easy and even fun. I had lots of empty bottles, so once it arrived I started to test it. I have been very pleased with what came out of it, it really gave a very authentic style for my bar. I cut empty bottles from a liquor brands I sell, one different bottle type for each light, totally I had to make 20 lamps, I have three lamps over each table and two lamps in the bar area. I am very pleased with this bottle cutter, I saved a lot of money with all the lamps and vases I created out of empty bottles, and besides that I gave my bar a very original look. I am glad I took a chance on this glass bottle cutter kit. Bottle cutter works perfectly, easy and simple.

It took around two tries to learn how to cut bottles correctly, and well.. since then I've been making glasses and vases with it like crazy, I even made an ashtray and it came out great. One over the other it's a quality product that surprised me in a pleasant way, very useful too. As for the glass cutter, it cuts fast and easy and I like that you can open the lid to refill it. Some time ago I ordered another model that couldn't be filled, so after it had no more oil it was just no longer any good. This is not the case with this one, you ca remove the lid and refill it with the little tool they give you.

Very satisfied with my purchase!", "This product works great once you get the hang of it! Product only comes with 3 wheels attached -- the last two you must mount on yourself if you ant them, but they aren't necessary. I found to get the best results, use a wrench to make sure the screw it SUPER tight and then slowly with even pressure with your hands on top of the bottle on either side of the blade and slowly turn the bottle taking care not to let the bottle jump (if it does, throw it away, it wont work) until you have a fine line. I also found that you don't need tons of pressure in order to make it work. You just need enough to get a fine line. The real work comes when heating the bottle. make sure that ALL side of the bottle have been slowly, evenly heated and then when you switch to cold water make sure to twist the bottle quickly under a cold stream to make sure that it cracks perfectly. I found when you don't heat it properly it will be almost perfect, but will leave you with a small bump or dip in the glass. It takes a bit of practice, but one you get the hang of it, it works great!!", 'Works great, clean, even cuts every time, so long as you pay a tiny bit of attention to make sure you don’t bump it while rolling the bottle. It grips the table really well, and doesn’t move. The l bracket brace is solid and sturdy.

Firstly, the "flames" do not look anything like the package. I knew that was the case, but I have seen others that look much more clear/in focus than these do. But, when viewed from the street, they do an ok job of impersonating flames. The issue I have is the "multi-modes". The modes are chosen automatically when you turn them on. I thought once I got them in sync (by unscrewing one until the modes matched), that they would stay that way. Nope. Last night I turned them on only to see that one was flaming and the other was pulsing. I had to go out and unscrew again until they were in sync. I can see that this is not a sustainable solution.

{'asin': 'B078J6WZYP', 'comments': ["We bought this item for my son a while back, and we just bought a second one for him to take on sleepovers, etc. This product has been a lifesaver for him and us. He could not breathe out of either nostril, which also meant he couldn't taste anything. This had been going on for years. Several years ago, we took him to an asthma and allergy specialist, who did a scan of his head and showed almost 100% blockage of his sinuses and nasal passages. He talked to us about surgery, but it didn't make sense because he is still growing and the Dr. decided to wait until he was done growing. Of course, we did not want to do this either given his age and the very invasive nature of the procedure. He was put on custom (very expensive) allergy drops, which we made him take twice a day. That was frustrating to stay on top of and after a full year we saw no results. We tried many other nasal lavage systems, but they made him gag and were cumbersome to use. So much so, that we couldn't get him to use them consistently so we saw no benefit. We saw this Res-Q-Rinse product and decided to give it a try. We were desperate since our son couldn't breathe at all through his nose and was not really eating well since he had no real sense of taste. It took a few days of using this product consistently, but all I can say is WOW! As you can see in the video, he has full flow through both nostrils! There is absolutely no gag reflex triggered with the simple design of the product and it's incredibly easy to use. He doesn't use it every day consistently...teenagers...but even so, he can always breathe through his nose and he has gained considerable weight since he actually enjoys eating now. I buy a lot on Amazon, and I never review products, but if you have someone in your family that is in the same situation, I believe this will give them the relief they are desperately needing!", 'I like it fine.

It does not get into your mouth or ears, which seems to be the concern I have with some other devices. The staff at Res Q Rinse gets back with you right away if you have questions.', 'Simply put: Excellent. I am suffering from a pesky summer cold, with a constant back drip. Mentioned my condition to colleagues in the office. Again, they suggested the Neti pot. I have been reluctant to use a Neti pot. I don’t even like to do the quick sniff and blow when washing my face. How in the hell am I going to use a Neti pot? They also warned only purchase a porcelain one for it keeps clean better than plastic ones. This said, I totally went out on a limb against all advice and purchased the Res-Q-Rinse. Plastic and all. I am pleased. It was comfortable, considering. It granted me immediate decongestant relief. The post-nasal drip almost completely gone.', 'Finally, a nasal irrigation system that works for me! I have used a Neti pot and an upright bottle in the past. The Neti pot made me waterlogged and the upright bottle wasn’t much better. I have used ResQRinse several times.

It’s easy to release the trapped water by lowering my head to my chin and then moving from one side to the other. No more day-long ear pain!

The first time using the product, I found it somewhat difficult to get the flow going, but from the 2nd use onwards, the Res-Q-Rinse performed just as advertised. I didn't experience any gagging and had none of the solution go down the back of my throat. The key is to tilt your head back while using it (this is written clearly in the directions). As far as the results, the Res-Q-Rinse relieved me of my congestion issues pretty much immediately after using it. The surprising and more impressive thing that occurred, was my congestion would be relieved for a few days after using the Res-Q-Rinse! I would strongly recommend people with allergies try the Res-Q-Rinse and see what kind of relief it can provide to you.", "So far this thing works really well for me.

I can say that using it in the mornings before I go for my run I'm breathing a lot better and all the yucky stuff is expelled before I run. I use it at night before going to bed and I'm breathing much better at night where as I was constantly fighting one side or the other of my sinus would be stuffy. It appears that there is light and the end of the tunnel, or should I say my nostrils. Time will tell but from all the research I've done this is exactly what I need. Using it is very easy too.

I do not know if the exterior will scratch over time and start to look bad - for the time being - I am very pleased. I could be even more pleased if it was not quite so expensive. Just saying. I really recommend this glass - for everyday use, parties, or any application.", "My father-in-law was breaking his martini glasses all the time. So much so that he stopped having them in his normal martini glasses and had them in other cups. We bought these as a jab at him for Christmas and he absolutely loves them. He keeps them in his freezer. He has to hand wash them but he doesn't care because they're so durable. It's hilariously awesome.", 'Do not buy these cups. There is a flaw somewhere in the distribution of these cups. I read several reviews that said the cups were scratched but sometimes feel like people can be ridiculous. These cups were destroyed before they came out of the box. There are scratches all over them. I haven’t even used the cups but based on their appearance, I will be returning them. I don’t know why a company would continue shipping these cups when they know there is an issue. Not a good look.', 'Hubby has a martini every night and always keeps a martini glass in the freezer with his vodka. After getting a new french door with pull out freezer on bottom, it was awkward for a regular martini glass & had a couple that broke. So I bought these and they are absolutely perfect! Plus, we like how they are not too cold to hold when drinking. They produce no condensation on the exterior and they keep the drink perfectly chilled. Highly recommend these!', 'Very nice! My wife loves a perfect martini. I am the one to make it. Standard shakers that you keep in the freezer are a pain in the pants and often stick together. You have to hold them with a rag for fear of freezing your fingers off. Enter the double wall shaker. Simple add crushed ice and let stand for about 2 mins. Add your favorite cocktail to be shaken and have at it. Well make and easy to clean!', 'The Snowfox martini glass keeps your drink chilled longer. We keep them in the freezer. It is fairly easy to pick up off the table unlike other short martini glasses. Holds a very large drink. Thin lip. Sturdy too!bDo it.', 'As martini glasses go, these look extremely good. I wanted them because I thought I could throw them into the freezer and it would keep my martini colder for longer. Unfortunately they do not keep your martini cold for much longer than if you were to just pour them into a normal glass martini glass. I would say your martini will stay colder for about 5-10 more minutes longer, I was hoping for a little bit longer because I usually sip on a martini for a good 30-40 minutes. I will still give them a 4 star rating though because it does keep your martini cooler for a bit longer and they look very good.', 'After breaking the last of my short neck glass martini glasses, I decided to give these a try. I was concerned about the "mouth feel" of stainless steel, but the curvature at the rim is perfect, so the lips feel no sharp edges. It\'s insulated design keeps the martini cold for quite a while, which far surpasses traditional glass martini glasses. I have dropped these martini glasses from a height of 3 feet several times and there are no dings. They also looks great! These will probably be the last martini glasses I\'ll ever buy and will probably be in use long after I\'m gone!']},

{'asin': 'B07DRQ3382', 'comments': ['Overall, a nice gift for a friend or relative, but don\'t expect the results indicated in the product description. I personally had below a 50% success rate, so your seeds may or may not grow into anything. Some of the negative aspects of my experience were as follows: 1. The soil discs were not packed well so the entire kit itself was covered in dehydrated soil creating a lot of dust upon opening. This may create some complications if you have strong allergies to dust/dirt or are planning to gift wrap the kit. 2. Some seed packs (namely the Brazilian Rosewood and Black Spruce) came in limited amounts of 4-5 seeds, whereas the other two seed packs had 12-15 seeds each. The Brazilian Rosewood seeds are also quite delicate and a good portion of them came chipped or broken when the kit arrived. As such, the Brazilian Rosewood seeds did not germinate. In addition, having a limited number of seeds decreases germination rates and the ability to "try again" if things don\'t work out the first time you sow the seeds. 3. There are no instructions on how to appropriately treat the D. Regia seeds. Apparently you need to use sand paper or some other tool to remove the hard outer shell in order for the seeds to germinate properly. I didn\'t do that the first time around and wasted seeds because I didn\'t know I needed to do that. It would\'ve been helpful to have those instructions available at the time I sowed the seeds. 4. The bags/sacks provided to house the soil and seeds on initial sowing do not have holes in the bottom to drain water. As a result, you do need to be extra careful when watering as there is a high probability of mold forming. In addition, the wooden markers absorb water and can help facilitate the growth of mold if you insert them into the soil. I would recommend using a plastic marker or nothing at all.', 'My husband wanted to try to grow his own bonzai trees, this kit seemed like it would be the perfect gift. He started growing them at the middle of October. And we are currently one and a 1/2 months into the growing portion. Only 1 type of seed has sprouted so far. We have been getting some mold on the dirt, but I do not think that is from the seeds. My other plants that I have growing in pots nearby also have mold. I do not know yet if it was a good purchase, I am hopeful that even if one plant grows it will be pretty cool. I had hoped that most or all of them would have at least sprouted. UPDATE: 3 months in and only 1 grew. Mold filled the bottom of the box, had to transplant just to save what did grow. Wish it would have worked.', 'A great little kit. To date 3 of my seed types have sprouted, I’m hoping the 4th will as well.', 'SEEDS SOWN: Oct 17, 2018 - I am in the early stages of this project (to the point of nothing yet sprouting), so there is no way i can leave a 100% accurate review as of now, i can say however, whether this be due to my source of water (regular tap) or the soil itself, some sort of micro fungus has begun to grow over the surface (top layer) of the soil. This fungus can be seen to the human eye i do not however have a camera good enough to prove my statement. I do not believe it to be harmful to the bonsai seeds; the look to be small versions of "Leucocoprinus birnbaumii" or the "Plantpot Dapperling", a common house plant infection, but this could mean the soil sent out by this company may be infected with some sort of fungal spore. I am enjoying the experience regardless of the spores, I do hope i am able to enjoy the bonsais if they begin to sprout and grow into beautiful little trees.', 'Update: they sent me a replacement, so, we are going to try to grow these ourselves and I will update with the quality of the seedlings, to see if that is more of a selling point.

I went to wrap the item as a Christmas gift and decided to remove the tape and paint came off with it. Now it looks ugly in the front and since I bought this specific bonsai kit for the aesthetics and gift worthiness I’m really disappointed. Why they even put tape on it if they are going to color the box with this material I do not know.', 'out of the 4 starter pots, 2 of the delonix sprouted and grew within 3 weeks. two of the pinus also grew within 4 weeks, but stalled in growth another week after that. i repotted the 2 delonix and they are still steadily growing. the pinus havent done much. as for the other two species, i havent seen anything at all. i still have more seeds so i try again but with regular potting mix', 'I just received my Bonsai kit, and I am very impressed with it. I love the wooden box it is all packaged in, and the little burlap pots to grow your seeds in are so clever. You get 4 different kinds of Bonsai seeds, and 4 pots.

As I am a garden enthusiast, I thought this would be a fun project to try. This would be a great gift for a young person to teach them the basics of cultivating seeds.

I asked for a full C when I went into sugary and came out with a whole lot more. That’s another story. I love these silicone covers! They totally work and support my giant heavy boobs. They also reduce the giggle of a natural breast, so you can’t even tell your not wearing a bra. This very well could become my daily bra.

My breasts are on the larger size but not huge and are really heavy so it takes a lot to hold them up. These covers held them up really well.

They didn't droop very much until the very end of the night but by then I think my whole body was drooping too. Lol!
