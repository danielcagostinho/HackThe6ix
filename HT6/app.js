I expected that what I received would not necessarily match the picture, because there is a natural variation in rocks. I did, however, expect that the colors would be vibrant as represented in the picture (they aren\'t). They are almost dingy, even after washing with a gentle soap and drying with a t-shirt as suggested to others here. It also grinds my gears that someone in these reviews was told by the seller (customer service) that these aren\'t real agate. If they\'re dyed stone to create the agate look, then that should be disclosed in the description. Fair play if it is now, but I read through at the time of my purchase it was not noted by the seller. The packaging was OK. A box within a box. The smaller box that contained the slices could have been done providing more protection; all four were wrapped in paper, but there was no buffer between the slices, so they have scratches from each other on the outside rim due to what can only be slightly rubbing against each other during packaging and ship. Not tragic, but another nudge toward the "meh". Rubber bumpers were not included in my package. I\'m semi-crafty, so I had some already. No big deal, but worthy of note since they are supposed to be included. Sizes varied greatly. Some are OK, but one in particular is barely large enough to hold a bottle of mildly impressive hipster grade beer. Also, the thickness of the slices vary greatly as well. One is thick enough to be considered a nice solid weight, one is normal and two are quite thin. I would worry about structural integrity if I was to accidentally drop it. (some may crack, but two would definitely shatter on impact). It kinda drives me a little nuts that I can\'t neatly stack them in a manner that is aesthetically pleasing.

Our 4.5 month son still has the Moro (startle) reflex, so he needed a sleep sack that lightly holds his arms. If he was not swaddled in a sleep sack, he woke up constantly... We were using the "Love to dream Swaddle Up 50/50" (highly recommend if your baby can bust out of swaddling blankets like ours). With the Swaddle Up sack, he was sleeping well and only waking once or twice per night to eat (if he woke up any other time he would fall back to sleep on his own). But once he learned to roll from front to back we had to free his arms for safety. Enter the Zen sleep sack. I was fully prepared for a nightmare transition to sleeping arms out. However, the first night he slept from 7:30pm to 5:30am straight! Then last night he slept from 7:30pm to 6:30am straight! I sent it to daycare with him yesterday as well. He sleeps in his crib at night but would scream and cry endlessly if laid in a crib for naps. He only wanted to sleep in the Rock N Play for naps. Daycare put the Zen sleep sack on him and laid him in the crib and he was knocked out within a minute and had his best naps yet (all three yesterday)! I know it\'s only been two days, but I am in love with this product. My son peed through his diaper last night, and wet the sack so I had to leave it at home to wash it. I am buying a second Zen sleep sack today so I am never without it again. I highly recommend!'}, {'id': 'b73ca889-665a-4cf0-aa36-befea51c4e51', 'content': '5 month old daughter had been only sleeping 2-4 hour stretches and up many times at night.

Frustrated I looked it up, ordered it and even paid the extra to have one day delivery. The first night he wore this I laid him down awake. He smiled up at me and proceeded to pass out on his own. Now he was a good sleeper before but not like this. This was game changing. Mind blowing. Jump up and down and scream yippee exciting. This kid never budged. He passed right out, woke up once to eat and promptly fell back asleep. It's been 3 week of sleep like this and it's the same every night. 3 glorious weeks. 3 weeks of a happy baby and a happy mama. If I haven't sold you yet just wait theres more! Have you set an alarm since your little one was born? Yeah me either. UNTIL NOW! We have not only gotten sleep but slept in until 9! no that is not a typo. Yes ladies and gentlemen! 9!!!! Step right up and buy your own for a restful night. Think about it. What does your baby want? He wants a little comfort while he is learning to put himself back to sleep. Comfort like your hand on his chest or in this case a little warm sleeping bag with a weighted pouch that mimics that exact feeling. Brilliant I tell you! This is amazing. Buy it. Don't think twice.

If left unswaddled he'd typically rub his eyes like crazy and keep himself up with his hands, then sleep with his hands over his head which I thought was normal, but I think they just ended up this way because he was restless.

But this kalimba allowed me to play simple songs via sheet music as expected, but within 30 min of picking it up I was transposing music into it's key on the fly and also improvising. The tuning & layout make it easy! It brought a thrill and a simple joy that I haven't felt in some time. Mine did not come with a tuning hammer, thus the 4 rather than 5 stars. I can't find a way to contact the seller but if I do and they send the hammer I will edit. In the description they recommend an Android tuning app. I tried that one, but I like the app called universal tuner better. kTabS is a computer program that will let you easily write or transpose kalimba music ($30).

The bulb and plastic body might crack from a drop. The clip would break or fall off. The battery would drain in my pocket. Not with this this. I think it's the way that these are designed. The sunken bulb means it's harder to damage from a drop. The clips (while they FEEL cheap) are pretty well-secured. The battery compartment screws tightly. The body is metal (aluminium?) and the button is covered by a rubber cap, so it doesn't turn on in my pocket. Each pen light also comes with replacement bulb in case it does break.

But, when viewed from the street, they do an ok job of impersonating flames. The issue I have is the "multi-modes". The modes are chosen automatically when you turn them on. I thought once I got them in sync (by unscrewing one until the modes matched), that they would stay that way. Nope. Last night I turned them on only to see that one was flaming and the other was pulsing. I had to go out and unscrew again until they were in sync. I can see that this is not a sustainable solution. I will need to look for another set that does flames only.'}]}

He could not breathe out of either nostril, which also meant he couldn't taste anything. This had been going on for years. Several years ago, we took him to an asthma and allergy specialist, who did a scan of his head and showed almost 100% blockage of his sinuses and nasal passages. He talked to us about surgery, but it didn't make sense because he is still growing and the Dr. decided to wait until he was done growing. Of course, we did not want to do this either given his age and the very invasive nature of the procedure. He was put on custom (very expensive) allergy drops, which we made him take twice a day. That was frustrating to stay on top of and after a full year we saw no results. We tried many other nasal lavage systems, but they made him gag and were cumbersome to use. So much so, that we couldn't get him to use them consistently so we saw no benefit. We saw this Res-Q-Rinse product and decided to give it a try. We were desperate since our son couldn't breathe at all through his nose and was not really eating well since he had no real sense of taste. It took a few days of using this product consistently, but all I can say is WOW! As you can see in the video, he has full flow through both nostrils! There is absolutely no gag reflex triggered with the simple design of the product and it's incredibly easy to use. He doesn't use it every day consistently...teenagers...but even so, he can always breathe through his nose and he has gained considerable weight since he actually enjoys eating now.

I personally had below a 50% success rate, so your seeds may or may not grow into anything. Some of the negative aspects of my experience were as follows: 1. The soil discs were not packed well so the entire kit itself was covered in dehydrated soil creating a lot of dust upon opening. This may create some complications if you have strong allergies to dust/dirt or are planning to gift wrap the kit. 2. Some seed packs (namely the Brazilian Rosewood and Black Spruce) came in limited amounts of 4-5 seeds, whereas the other two seed packs had 12-15 seeds each. The Brazilian Rosewood seeds are also quite delicate and a good portion of them came chipped or broken when the kit arrived. As such, the Brazilian Rosewood seeds did not germinate. In addition, having a limited number of seeds decreases germination rates and the ability to "try again" if things don\'t work out the first time you sow the seeds. 3. There are no instructions on how to appropriately treat the D. Regia seeds. Apparently you need to use sand paper or some other tool to remove the hard outer shell in order for the seeds to germinate properly. I didn\'t do that the first time around and wasted seeds because I didn\'t know I needed to do that. It would\'ve been helpful to have those instructions available at the time I sowed the seeds. 4. The bags/sacks provided to house the soil and seeds on initial sowing do not have holes in the bottom to drain water. As a result, you do need to be extra careful when watering as there is a high probability of mold forming. In addition, the wooden markers absorb water and can help facilitate the growth of mold if you insert them into the soil. I would recommend using a plastic marker or nothing at all.'}, {'id': '1101117d-7ce6-4be5-a7d3-7bb04adb78cb', 'content': 'My husband wanted to try to grow his own bonzai trees, this kit seemed like it would be the perfect gift.

I do not know yet if it was a good purchase, I am hopeful that even if one plant grows it will be pretty cool. I had hoped that most or all of them would have at least sprouted.

This fungus can be seen to the human eye i do not however have a camera good enough to prove my statement. I do not believe it to be harmful to the bonsai seeds; the look to be small versions of "Leucocoprinus birnbaumii" or the "Plantpot Dapperling", a common house plant infection, but this could mean the soil sent out by this company may be infected with some sort of fungal spore.

When I received this product I immediately ironed out the wrinkles of the mats and placed them on my table. The mats have a kind of bubbly texture, in which they do not lay completely flat and have a linen texture. They looked decent until it was time to wash them. I followed the instructions to wash with cold water and delicate. I finished by drying with no heat and only air spin in the dryer. When it was finished they were extremely wrinkled (as expected), so I ironed them like I did the first time. They never has the same fit as when originally bought. The elastic ring on the outside seemed to fit smaller and totally made these mats unusable after one wash. I would not recommend using these if you want mats that are easy to manage. Save your money and use something thicker with better materials.'}, {'id': '5d51e880-34e3-4a99-99ec-b47991f5d891', 'content': "These were perfect for what I needed them for! They were going under some plastic placemats for a colored backing. They arrived in a box, folded up- so if you are going to use them alone they will need to be washed and dried to get the fold lines out. They are very thin, I wouldn't use them alone on a wooden table top- not thick enough to protect against heat on a plate. But again great for what I needed them for!"}, {'id': 'c140fb7b-e51a-4bf4-a2d3-c03cf11c0eb4', 'content': 'These are good quality. They are a little darker then I was thinking they would be.'}, {'id': 'e3d66fc7-58aa-4aee-97f1-a2a603d33516', 'content': 'The item arrived on time and in a beautiful package. It looks great on the table and fits the decor. The only draw back is...because they are linen they get very wrinkled after washing. Otherwise I am very impressed.'}, {'id': '6474bb6a-5d93-4109-924f-82e36b073745', 'content': 'This were more delicate than I was looking for. The color was true as was the size. They were smaller than most circle placemats, which is what I was looking for.

The only con is when you unfold them you see the lines and after you iron them you still see the lines.
